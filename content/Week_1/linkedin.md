## Linkedin Strategy

Copy your resume content to Linkedin. If it's your first time setting up an account please make sure to keep things professional. You can use an AI generated image for now but don't make it look too synthetic. 

- **Adding connections:** Linkedin connections aren't like instagram. You can request to connect even if you haven't met the person before. I generally add all of the people I've met, then add all of the people that they know. 
- **Following people:** Follow recruiters and other leaders who will probably not have the time to review their connections page. These people will post about internships and repost from their collegues. 
- **Networking tips:** One past mentee reached out to MAANG engineers who knew his native language with a template such as the following - he was offered 5 internships that year: "Your journey is inspirational. As someone who is just starting out, what would you recommend I prioritize in my internship search. Could we hop on a call to chat more about your journey?"
- **Job alerts:** Set job alerts for reach, normal, safe companies and regions. 
  - Reach could be for Big-7 anywhere in the states
  - Normal could be for any fortune 500
  - Safe could be for local companies who may not be well known
