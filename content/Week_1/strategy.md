## Application Strategy

"No matter how successful people may look on LinkedIn, there was a time in their life when they didn't have any experience"

You have limited time to apply, so strategizing will be important. Balancing Reach and Safe internships will be important. 
- A lot of factors will impact your strategy such as the current economy (not good), labor needs (not good), your past experience
- Reach/Safe internships:
  - 70/30 if you have deployed projects or youtube videos
  - 50/50 if you have past class/hobby projects  
  - 30/70 if you only have class projects
  - University research lab internships if you don't have past class experience
