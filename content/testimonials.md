### ðŸ“Š Testimonials

"I got an unpaid offer. The experience was amazing, it taught me a lot, weeks were really well planned out. Gave me a lot of strategies. I loved being able to have one on ones."

"Offer from TAMU-CC AgTech REU. The experience was absolutely amazing, there was never a week or session I felt was being wasted. With the bootcamp having plenty of industry mentors and experts come in to provide resources alongside Talha, I was always excited to see who I can connect with and take the next step in my career with each and every week. Talha's own experience with REU's gave a niche personal touch that is hard to find elsewhere. His expertise was incredibly invaluable, sitting with me for up to an hour prepping for my interview 1-on-1 prior to my offer. I don't know if I would have secured the offer without him. Overall, I loved the program and am very thankful for my internship opportunity from this bootcamp, especially as a freshman with no prior internships."

"Talha did very well with advising what steps to take during which stage of the job search process. Ä° recommend this bootcamp and indeed Ä° myself was a cohort for two seasons! There is too much to lose in not attending this program!"

"I am in the final round of the hiring process with great tech startup. To be honest, this camp gave me so much insights into the hiring process, so that I was able to land this internship bypassing whole recruiting process. I literally became a top candidate for the role despite competing with applicants from the TOP schools and Ivy League, with much less work experience. I loved that we were able to talk to Company Managers with a lot of experience. Essentially, the advice that you gave us actually played out in my favor to get this internship."
